POSTGRESQL INSTALLATION ON UBUNTU

--- This tutorial assumes you have not tried to install PostgreSQl already ---

1) Establish a clean baseline to work with:
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get autoremove

2) Add the PostgreSQL Repository:
	wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

   ***NOTE*** You need to replace the word "codename" in the following url with the result of the command:
   	lsb_release -c

   	sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ codename-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'

3) Install PostgreSQL 9.3 using aptitude
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get -f install
	sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3 pgadmin3

4) Assuming this all went well you will need to now set up your postgresql database
	sudo -i -u postgres
	createuser --interactive

	--- Type in your username here, and say yes to superuser priviledges ---

	createdb <username_you_just_typed_in>
	exit

5) Make sure that you set everything up right
	psql

	--- As long as this doesn't give any errors it worked ---

6) Set up the bubhub database
	--- From the root directory of the rails application ---
	bundle exec rake db:create
	bundle exec rake db:migrate
